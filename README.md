# Attrition-Whisperer 
A data-powered, AI-enhanced workforce analytics project that predicts employee attrition and explain it in plain English using GPT. I combined advanced analytics with stakeholder storytelling.

## Objective
This project aims to:
1. Predict which employees are at risk of leaving
2. Understand **why** they're likely to leave
3. Auto-generate executive summaries with **GPT-4** for business leaders

## Tech Stack
1. Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, OpenAI API
2. Jupyter Notebooks
3. Tableau
4. Logistic Regression for binary classification
5. GPT-4 for natural language summaries

## Key Insights
1. Achieved **85.5% accuracy** in predicting employee attrition.
2. Top features identified influencing churn- race, job satisfaction, role and by department
3. **GPT-4** generated real time summaries:
   > "Production Department has 31.8% attrition risk. Drivers: Low Engagement, high overtime, Considering bonus revision and additional benefits."

## What I Learned
1. How to combine classical ML with modern LLMs
2. Techniques for people analytics using real-world data
3. How to explain complex models to non-technical stakeholders
